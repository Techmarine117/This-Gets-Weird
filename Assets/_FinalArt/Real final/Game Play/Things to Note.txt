Things to Note:

- You can remove the Metallic Smoothness for the Switch in Unity because it makes the overall texture darker but that is up to you 

- Pipes 1-3 textures were combined for efficiency but I imported both separate and combined models just in case

- Pipe 4 wheel was exported separately so you can turn that as needed
