Things to Note: 

- The flowers for the healthy Vines were exported separately so that the opacity map can affect that part only. The texture for this ends in .tif and it has an embedded Alpha Map 

- The .tif file needs to be inserted into the Base Map 

- AO and Metallic Smoothness are optional as they do not affect the texture as much, they are just there for propriety
